# Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections

  ## First Example 
  You could use this script for the other counties in the area or around the country, all you need would be to gather all of the votes from different methods and import that data into the script and watch the program swift their all of these information at once. 
  
  ## Second Example
  Another thing that could be modify and used for other election would be to see which voting method is the most popular and most practical way for voters to vote. This could give local, state and federal election committes a much deeper understanding on how to maximize their efficeny in receving and tallying up votes.
